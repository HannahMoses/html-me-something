               <h2> Christmas wreaths </h2>

               <h2> Week one </h2>
             <p>      The day was going superbly !<br> What a day
                to celebrate <strong> Christmas !</strong> The church 
                building was overflowingwith people. Kids of all ages
                were dressed up in colorful,<em> new clothes </em>and 
                could hardly contain their excitement. Even their Sunday 
                school teachers gave up on quietening them during the 
                church service. So the kid's excited, hushed converstion
                formed a background sound for the sermon, sort of like
                a bass key notes of a hymn. The pastor was smiling through
                the sermon and added a few lyrics of old hymns, to
                emphasise the jubiliation of the day.He had a great voice
                and it only enhanced the festive atmosphere ! On! boy!
                did I sing my heart out,that day , in our church choir !</p>
  
             <p>     Everything, good or bad, happy or sad would have to end
                 eventually !<em> Time takes care of that, doesn't it ?</em>
                 The church service ended with the hymn ,"Joy to the world !"
                 I came home with my family, after echanging greetings with 
                 our friends. The smiling faces of my SUnday school students,
                 as they surrounded me, showing off their finery and sharing
                 anecdotes about their gifts seemed like Christmas wreaths hung
                 all around my soul ! What awesome images of wreaths, I had
                 carried home in my soul, that Christmas day !<br>

                 Riding home with my dad had always opened up some theological discussion
                 and that Christmas day was no different.Dear old dad ! How I 
                 miss him! He'd never let me float away on superficial happiness
                 always insisting me to draw from the well of Joy ,that never
                 changes with my circumstances.We both reached home joyful.</p>

              <p>    My grandparents had already moved in with us a few years
                  ago, after they had retired. Our maid was helping my grandma
                  set the table for our Christmas feast. My uncle's family had
                  come to visit us for Christmas and my nieces were already 
                  bombarding my aunt with a thousand one questions.How on earth
                  my aunt remains tranquil, like a quiet, gurgling brook, I cannot
                  fathom. In her own sweet, way, she eventually managed to herd
                  all my nieces to their places at the table- all washed and proper.
                  As soon as all our family members were seated around the table,
                  my grandpa said grace and we dived into the delicacies. As always,
                  my dear old granny had saved a special piece of meat for my dad,
                  her son-in-law. As a kid, I used to be jealous of my granny's
                  motherly attention to my dad,since I was her very own favorite.
                  But now,as a teen, I found it quite amusing, to see her like a
                  mother hen around my dad, whose mom had already passed away.</p>

               <p>    During the Christmas feast, granpa told us, all the usual folk
                  lore ,that made us go back in time. My dad always treated him
                  as the head of the family. I learnt respecting elders from what
                  I caught my dad doing. It was my dad's life that made a humble
                  human being, out of my "proud peacock" self ! My mom had always
                  made sure, that I was well taught and equipped to be an over-achiever
                  at school, home, church and our community. It is hard not to be
                  a proud peacock, when surrounded by appreciation every where I
                  went. My dad had always directed me away from drawing my worth
                  or happiness from the swelling of pride.He had always reminded
                  me to draw from the well of Joy within me - not from the swell
                  of applause around me.Did he know, that GOd was using him to
                  train me for the very different future that was in store from me ?
                  May be not ! But he trained me as a child, in the way he wanted
                  me to be ,when I grew older.And our world is surely a better place
                  today, because of my dad's endeavors in parenting.THere is no telling,
                  how much damage a single spoiled kid could do to this world at large !</p>

                <p>      I was still savoring, the sweet motherly affection, my granny
                  showers my dad with, when my grandpa asked my dad, if he was still
                  planning to visit his outreach village ,even on the Christmas day.
                  When my dad answered in an affirmative, my grandpa said,"It is not
                  sad not to spend Christmas with your own family."There they were!
                  The words that ended my sweet musings and treasured memories ! Didn't
                  I alread write ,that, everything, good or bad, happy or sad would have
                  to end eventually ! I had not expected, such an abrupt end ,though !
                  My dad saw the disapproval on my grandpa's face and the disappointment
                  on our faces and blurted out,"I think, I'll bundle up the kids and 
                  take them with us, to enjoy this Christmas day, with the villagers !"
                  That was the one and only time, my grandpa couldn't find any logic to
                  make a comment in favor or otherwise .So, off we went on our merry way,
                  to celebrate Christmas in the village square !

                   <h2> Week two </h2>
                 <p>        It was already <strong>New Year's Day !</strong>  
                 What a week, it had been ! I sat looking at the "Fire of the
                forest" tree, in front of our house. I was ready for church and
                waiting for my family on our front porch.I could have been helping
                them in someway; someone always manages to misplace a ring, or a
                hair band or some other accessory on New Year's Day.SOrt of like
                a family ritual, really ! But I was dweeling on the fact, that my 
                would be taking me to the village again.I'd meet the village kids,
                again ! They were very different from my regular SUnday school 
                students. There was a world of difference, and yet, they lived barely
                two hours away.How could I not have met these kids, for years,until
                my grandpa's Christmas outbust, a week ago !</p>
